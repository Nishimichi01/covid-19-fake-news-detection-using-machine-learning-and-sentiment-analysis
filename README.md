# covid-19-fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning-and-sentiment-analysis

fake new dataset.csv - raw dataset that has not been cleaned or preprocessed yet

MODEL EXPERIMENT.ipynb - Python notebook file where all the process of cleaning and preprocessing the dataset has been done and where the experiment to determine which machine learning algorithm that perform well to detect fake news from social media

tfidfvect.pkl - model file that been produced to use the tfidf and the machine learning model later in the website
model.pkl - machine learning model that has chose the best algorithm and saved the model in pkl format to be upload into website later

power bi machine learning model - dashboard that has been created using power bi software to present and compare the result for each machine learning algorithm performance and compare it with the result for sentiment analysis that has been done
